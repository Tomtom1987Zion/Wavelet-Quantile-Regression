# Wavelet-Quantile-Regression
To run the Wavelet Quantile Regression (WQR), first, ensure that all required R packages (waveslim, quantreg, tidyverse, readxl, and wranglR) are installed and loaded. The script begins by loading the dataset (DATA.xlsx) and defining dependent (DEP) and independent (IND) variables. Using wavelet multi-resolution analysis (MRA), the dataset is decomposed into different frequency components, enabling an assessment of short-, medium-, and long-term dependencies. The Quantile Regression (QR) is then applied across different quantiles (0.05 to 0.95), estimating slope coefficients (rho) that describe the quantile-dependent relationship between the variables. The results are stored in a structured dataframe and visualized using a heatmap (level plot), where color gradients represent varying strengths and directions of relationships across quantiles and time horizons.
